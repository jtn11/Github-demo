this is the first commit after initialisation 

this would be the code that will be resetting hard 
this is new changes here 


after git reset --hard pushing these changes 
so basically 
git reset --soft <hash>  : no changes in working directory , will move in staging area (that is after git add -A)
git reset --mixed <hash> : no change in working directory , will move outside staging area initial phase
git reset --hard<hash> : changes working directory as well till the hash provided
